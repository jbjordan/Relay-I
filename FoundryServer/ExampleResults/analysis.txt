Here’s a concise, data‑driven analysis of the uploaded game logs, addressing your 11 questions. I’ve cited the relevant log excerpts inline so you can verify each figure.

Executive summary
- The samples contain at least 8 distinct sessions (TrackingIDs) and are all on Level 1 in the excerpts provided. Session lengths vary widely, from as short as a few seconds to several minutes. The data show frequent PlayerTimer events, multiple CoinCollected/CoinCount events, some PlayerDeath events, and recurring Error messages tied to an animation system. See details below with exact IDs and examples.  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]

1) How many unique sessions?
- Observed TrackingIDs (at least eight distinct sessions):
  - 409d47fc-82f7-4496-a931-18e7a79be879
  - 538603df-0c61-4551-a757-b025b4584d34
  - c800491e-66f3-4929-aa61-d2c51715edbb
  - 6d4e5bb7-bcf3-4f2c-9c70-53564ab90842
  - f32afc53-b1c5-46e6-9fbb-184c609a306c
  - 21e0fa48-3185-44e5-bc2b-3b5d988fb737
  - 1f931a72-20f0-45be-8614-18ae6ca323c3
  - dbcf33f6-7754-4208-93e3-88abdb4cd012
- These IDs appear in the provided log snippets, confirming eight separate sessions (and likely more in the complete log f [relayserver.txt]7fc… in several entries, 538603df…, c800491e…, 6d4e5bb7…, etc.  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]

2) What is the average session length?
- Method: I used the final ElapsedTime seen per TrackingID (i.e., the session length as the last timestamped ElapsedTime for that ID). The approximate final times observed are:
  - 409d47fc-…: 323 seconds
  - 538603df-…: 28 seconds
  - c800491e-…: 5 seconds
  - 6d4e5bb7-…: 86 seconds
  - f32afc53-…: 51 seconds
  - 21e0fa48-…: 34 seconds
  - 1f931a72-…: 60 seconds
  - dbcf33f6-…: 39 seco [relayserver.txt] 5 + 86 + 51 + 34 + 60 + 39 = 626 seconds
- Average ≈ 626 / 8 ≈ 78.3 seconds
- Notes: The 8 session samples above come from the excerpts showing the final ElapsedTime values for each TrackingID (examples shown in the cited lines).

- Longest observed session length (final ElapsedTime per session): 323 seconds (TrackingID 409d47fc-82f7-4496-a931-18e7a79be879). This appears in multiple lines near the top of the samples.  [relayserver.txt]

4) What is the shortest session length?
- Shortest observed session length: 5 seconds (TrackingID c800491e-66f3-4929-aa61- [relayserver.txt]5-second final ElapsedTime in the excerpt).  [relayserver.txt]

5) What is the most common event?
- From the excerpts, PlayerTimer appears repeatedly within every session, and is present in the majority of the logs alongside other events. This makes PlayerTimer the most common event in the observed samples. Examples showing repeated PlayerTimer entries include the 6d4e5bb7 session and others where PlayerTimer lines appear frequently.  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]

6) What is the least common event?
- Within the sampled data, there are multiple event types (CoinCollected, CoinCount, PlayerDeath, Error, etc.). PlayerDeath occurs in several sessions but not in all, making it less frequent tha [relayserver.txt]Timer in the samples. The Death events are observable in multiple sessions (e.g., c800491e-…, 538603df-…, 21e0fa48-…), indicating they’re not as common as the timer events across the excerpts.  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]

7) What levels have the most time?
- All shown logs use LevelId "1". There is no evidence in the excerpts of LevelId 2 being used, so Level 1 accounts for [relayserver.txt] these samples. This is visible in multiple entries (e.g., 6d4e5bb7… shows LevelId:"1", as do other sessions).  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]

8) How often do players die?
- Based on the sampled sessions, PlayerDeath events occur in several sessions (at least 4–5 of the 8 sessions shown). This suggests deaths occur in a substantial fraction of sessions, tho [relayserver.txt]ion. Examples: 538603df-… shows a PlayerDeath, c800491e-… shows a PlayerDeath, 21e0fa48-… shows a PlayerDeath, 1f931a72-… shows a PlayerDeath, and f32afc53-… shows a PlayerDeath in the samples.

9) Where do players die most often?
- All observed deaths occur in Level 1 in the excerpts [relayserver.txt]ary, but several examples cluster around Level 1 coordinates near x ranging roughly from 441 to 891 and y around -113 to -114 (e.g., (891.6437, -113.0), (441.0, 139.0), (838.3167, -114.0), (1245.771, -113.0)). This suggests deaths are most common in Level 1, at mid-to-right portions of the level.  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]

10) What do you suggest to increase the average session length?
- Targeted fixes and design tweaks, informed by the data:
  - Address the recurring animation errors (AnimationMixer: 'RESET', Value Track: '.:position' must have at least one key…) which appe [relayserver.txt]educing or eliminating these errors should reduce abrupt session ends and player frustration. See multiple Error lines in the samples.  [relayserver.txt]
  - Improve early survivability in Level 1 to reduce instant or very early deaths (e.g., death events occurring within the first 60 seconds in several sessions). Consider adj [relayserver.txt]ving hitpoint balance, or adding a forgiving checkpoint early in the level. Example death events occur across several sessions (coordinates and times shown in the citations).  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]
  - Increase positive feedback and progression hooks (more frequent coins/collectibles, small rewards, visible progress indicators) to encourage longer play sessions; logs show coins being collected and counted, which can be l [relayserver.txt]hort-term milestones.  [relayserver.txt]
  - If feasible, add check-point style saves or shorter retry loops to reduce frustration from long restarts after a death. This is a common tactic when players repeatedly die in a level.
  - Consider re [relayserver.txt] separate “Error” events that interrupt flow, or surface them to users with helpful in-game messages rather than as log noise.  [relayserver.txt]

11) Are there any likely bugs based on the data?
- Yes. The logs show repeated “Error” events t [relayserver.txt]system (AnimationMixer: 'RESET', Value Track: '.:position' must have at least one key to cache for blending). These consistently appear across sessions and could indicate a bug or misconfiguration in the animation pipeline that can cause stuttering, visual glitches, or even game crashes if not addressed. Examples appear across multiple sessions.  [relayserver.txt]  [relayserver.txt]
- There are also occasional 0 ElapsedTime entries and “No request body” / intermittent log noise which may point to transient network or logging issues rather than gameplay bugs, but they’re worth monitoring to ensure they aren’t masking a session-tracking problem.  [relayserver.txt]
- The data show LevelId consistently as 1 in the excerpts; if there are supposed to be two levels, you’ll want to verify whether Level 2 logs exist elsewhere and ensure the two-level progression is being recorded consistently. The current samples focus on Level 1.  [relayserver.txt]

Notes and caveats
- The analysis above is based on the excerpts provided in the uploaded logs. If the full log file contains additional sessions or LevelId 2 entries, the numbers (especially the exact session count, averages, and death distribution) could shift.
- For precise calculations, a small script that:
  - groups by TrackingID to extract the final ElapsedTime per session (session length),
  - counts events per TrackingID for mode/least common events,
  - sums ElapsedTime by LevelId,
  - and tallies PlayerDeath events with their LevelId/Location
  would give you exact figures and allow easy re-run if new logs are added.

If you’d like, I can run a precise pass over the entire file (or a larger excerpt) to produce exact counts and a more formal set of charts (e.g., per-session lengths histogram, death heatmap by LevelId/Location, etc.).
